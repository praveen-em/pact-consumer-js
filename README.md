# Pact Demo JS - Consumer

## Introduction
It is a Product Catalog website (same example used in [Pact JS Workshop](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js)) to demonstrate contract testing using pact-js from consumer perspective. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information. Product Service is the provider which provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.
